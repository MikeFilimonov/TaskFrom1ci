<h1>Default GL accounts</h1>
<p>The chart of accounts you have in 1C:Drive is used as a basis for accounting the transactions you register in 1C:Drive.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="ChartOfAccounts.PrimaryChartOfAccounts/Help">Primary chart of accounts</a>.</p>
<p>To specify which account 1C:Drive should use for each business operation, the list of default GL accounts is available.</p>
<p>To open the default GL accounts for your company:</p>
<ul><li>Click <b>Company &gt; Enterprise &gt; Default GL accounts</b>. </li></ul><p>Each record in the list defines the mapping between a business operation (like Expenses, Inventory, or Other Income) in terms of 1C:Drive and an account that belongs to the chart of accounts.</p>
<p>For a mapping record in the list, you can change the account assigned.</p>
<p>If you change the account in a mapping record, it does not affect existing items in 1C:Drive including those that are already linked to the mapping.</p>
<p>For instance, a loan contract document stores a link to the principal GL account 1C:Drive assigned automatically according to the mapping record for the Loans borrowed business operation. If you specify another default GL account for the Loans borrowed business operation, the loan contract document remains intact.</p>
<p>Though, if you repost existing documents afterwards, 1C:Drive applies the updated mapping to these documents.</p></body></html>
