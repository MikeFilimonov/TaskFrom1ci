<h1>Debit notes</h1>
<p>When you order goods or services from your supplier and you have already registered a supplier invoice, you may need to reduce your company's debt to the supplier. For example, your supplier agreed to give you an extra discount or you request a goods return because there was a supply of damaged goods.</p>
<p>In this scenario, your supplier issues a credit note document to your company and, once you receive it, you register a debit note document in 1C:Drive. This document serves as the evidence of the reduction in your purchases.</p>
<p>In the debit note, you list the products, quantities, and agreed prices for products or services that your company ordered from the supplier, but your company returned or did not receive them. Also, you can use a debit note if you simply want to adjust the debt amount provided that the supplier confirmed this.</p>
<p>Typically, you state the reason for the debit note and refer to the original supplier invoice.</p>
<p>You can get the credit from the supplier as reduction of your debt to their company, or you can apply the credit to the future purchases.</p>

</li><li><b>Adjustment amount</b>. The money amount to reduce your company's debt to the supplier. 1C:Drive changes the value of this field automatically according to the content of the debit note you edit.

<h3>Specifying debit note amount allocation</h3>
<p>When you register a debit note for a supplier, you need to decide how to allocate the adjusted amount. Mainly, it depends on whether your company has performed a payment to the supplier for the basis invoice before you register the debit note.</p>
<p>If there was a payment to the supplier, reduce your company's debt for the invoice by the debit note's amount. If there was no payment to the supplier so far, allocate the amount as an advance payment.</p>

<ol><li>Open the debit note. 
</li><li>Click the <b>Amount allocation</b> tab. 
</li><li>Click <b>Fill in</b>.

</li><li>If necessary, in the <b>Offset amount</b> column, change the offset amount for the allocated amount record. 
</li><li>If necessary, in the <b>Document</b> column, select another invoice for the allocated amount record. 
<p>There is no need to specify the document for the offset amount if you specified that you allocate it as an advance payment.</p>
</li><li>If necessary, in the <b>Order</b> column, specify the purchase order for the allocated amount record. 
<p>Also, you can add, edit, or delete table records.</p></li></ol><a name="specifying_debit_note_reason"></a>
