<h1>Goods issues</h1>
<p>A <em>goods issue</em> is a document that registers the physical transfer of goods from your company to any third party without transfer of title. For instance, if your company sends goods to a customer, you can create a goods issue in 1C:Drive to register the fact that the goods departed from the warehouse to the customer's premises, print a <em>delivery note</em> in 1C:Drive, and accompany the goods with it. The delivery note is to be signed by the customer upon delivery.</p>
<p>Typically, you generate a goods issue from one or several sales orders. Also, you can generate several goods issues from a single sales order.</p>
<p>Similarly, you can generate one or several sales invoices from a goods issue, or generate a single sales invoice from several goods issues.</p>
<p>Why you might need to use an intermediate goods issue document within the <em>sales order-sales invoice</em> sequence?</p>
<p>If you issue a sales invoice before goods delivery and you need to change the sales invoice (for instance, the customer did not accept some of the goods), you have to issue a credit note, which may be inconvenient. With goods issues, you first supply the goods to your customer, and then, after you ensure that the customer accepted the goods, you issue one or several sales invoices for the goods you actually delivered. Thus, you minimize corrections in the sales invoices.</p>
<p>If the customer accepts some of the goods and returns the rest back, you issue a <em>goods receipt</em> document.</p>
<h2>Viewing goods issues</h2>
<p>To view the list of goods issues:</p>
<ul><li>Click <strong>Sales &gt; Sales &gt; Goods issues</strong>. </li></ul><h2>Checking which goods are shipped and invoiced</h2>
<p>The <strong>Status</strong> column of the goods issue list shows whether each goods issue is covered with sales invoices. The following values are available:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Not invoiced</strong>. None of the goods registered in the goods issue is included in sales invoices. 
</li><li><strong>Partially invoiced</strong>. Some of the goods registered in the goods issue are included in sales invoices. 
</li><li><strong>Invoiced</strong>. All goods registered in the goods issue are included in sales invoices. </li></ul><p>This helps you verify that you issued sales invoices that you can use to claim money for the shipped goods.</p>
<p>Alternatively, to check which goods your company shipped with or without invoices, you can use the <strong>Goods shipped not invoiced</strong> report.</p>
