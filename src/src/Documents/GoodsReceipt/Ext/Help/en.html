<h1>Goods receipts</h1>
<p>Sometimes your company might receive ordered goods from a supplier before you receive the invoice for the goods.</p>

<p>In such a case, you register a <em>goods receipt</em> document in 1C:Drive to enter the information on the goods and their quantity.</p>

<p>Using goods receipts in the purchase flow helps you to register the fact you received the goods without a supplier invoice.</p>

<p>Typically, you register a goods receipt for one or several purchase orders. Also, you can register several goods receipts for a single purchase order.</p>


<p>Similarly, you can register one or several supplier invoices from a goods receipt, or register a single supplier invoice from several goods receipts.</p>

<h2>Viewing goods receipts</h2>
<p>To view the list of goods receipts:</p>
<ul><li>Click <strong>Purchases &gt; Purchases &gt; Goods receipts</strong>. </li></ul><p>You can create, edit, or delete sales goods receipts.</p>

<h2>Checking which goods are received and invoiced</h2>

<p>The <strong>Status</strong> column of the goods receipt list shows whether each goods receipt is invoiced. The following values are available:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Draft</strong>. The goods receipt is saved but not posted yet.</li>
<li><strong>Not invoiced</strong>. None of the goods registered in the goods receipt is included in supplier invoices.</li>
<li><strong>Partially invoiced</strong>. Some of the goods registered in the goods receipt are included in supplier invoices.</li>
<li><strong>Invoiced</strong>. All goods registered in the goods receipt are included in supplier invoices.</li>
<li><strong>Not applicable</strong>. The goods registered in the goods receipt are not to be invoiced. For instance, consigned goods.</li>
</ul><p>This helps you verify that you registered supplier invoices that your supplier can use to claim money for the goods you received.
</p>

<p>Alternatively, to check which goods your company received with or without invoices, you can use the <strong>Goods received not invoiced</strong> report.</p>

<ul><li>To generate the report for all goods receipts, click <strong>Purchases &gt; Reports &gt; Goods receipts not invoiced</strong>. 

</li><li>To generate the report for a specific goods receipt, open the goods receipt and click the <strong>Goods receipts not invoiced</strong> link.</li></ul><a name="goods_receipt_fields"></a>
