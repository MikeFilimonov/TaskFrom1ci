<h1>Quotations</h1>
<p>A <em>quotation</em> is a document that your company submits to a potential customer. It lists the proposed prices for your goods or services. It is normally based on certain conditions provided by the customer.</p>
<p>You can use a quotation as the first document in a sales flow. For instance, you can create and send a quotation to your customer, then create a sales order based on the quotation, then create a sales invoice based on the sales order, then create a payment document based on the sales invoice or the sales order, and so on. Alternatively, you can create a payment document directly based on the quotation.</p>

<h2>Specifying goods and services to sell</h2>
<p>To specify the goods and services your company sells to a customer according to a quotation, use the <strong>Products</strong> tab of the quotation page.</p>
<p>The table on the tab lists all goods and services the customer is to pay for, their prices, quantities, the VAT amount, and the total amount. In the table, you can add, edit, and delete items.</p>
<p>Adding an item and filling its fields is a straightforward way to populate the products table. Also, you can copy existing items, paste them to the table, and update their fields.</p>
<p>Another way to populate the products table is as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Selecting products </li></ul><a name="selecting_products"></a>
<h3>Selecting products</h3>
<p>When selling a product you might want to select it by different criteria.</p>
<p>For this purpose, use the product selection tool. To open it:</p>
<ul><li>On the <strong>Products</strong> tab of the quotation, click <strong>Select</strong>. </li></ul><p>For more information, see <a href="DataProcessor.ProductsSelection/Help">Selecting products for sales documents</a>.</p><a name="specifying_quotation_variants"></a>
<h2>Specifying quotation variants</h2>
<p>Sometimes, when communicating with a customer on a particular deal, you might need to prepare more than one variant of the same quotation to let the customer choose an appropriate one among them.</p>
<p>For instance, in one quotation variant, you specify one equipment model and installment works, while in another variant, you specify another model and the same installment works.</p>
<p>For this purpose, in 1C:Drive, for a quotation, you can create any number of its alternative variants, edit or delete them. Each variant has its own set of goods and services specified.</p>
<h3>Viewing quotation variants</h3>
<p>1C:Drive displays all variants of a quotation on the <strong>Products</strong> tab of the quotation.</p>
<p>By default, a quotation contains a single quotation variant.</p>
<p>Among the quotation variants, one variant is selected. For the selected variant, 1C:Drive displays its content (goods and services) on the <strong>Products</strong> tab and lets you edit it. For more information, see <a href="#specifying_goods_and_services_to_sell">Specifying goods and services to sell</a>.</p>
<p>To display another variant of the quotation:</p>
<ul><li>On the <strong>Products</strong> tab of the quotation, select this variant. </li></ul><p>In a quotation, you can mark one of its variants as the preferred variant. For instance, the one your customer has chosen. You cannot delete this variant unless you mark another variant as the preferred one.</p>
<p>When you create other documents based on a quotation, 1C:Drive uses the content of the quotation's preferred variant.</p>
<p>To mark a quotation variant as the preferred one:</p>
