<h1>Sales invoices</h1>
<p>A sales invoice is the written verification of an agreement between a buyer and a seller of goods and services. When you sell goods or services to your customer, you register a sales invoice in 1C:Drive and send a hard copy to the customer to confirm the customer's obligation to pay for your goods and services.</p>
<p>Your sales process can include sales invoice as a final step that follows quotation, sales order, or goods issue. Or the sales process can simply start with sales invoice.</p>
<p>As the next step of your sales process, depending on the local legislation, you might need to register a tax invoice issued based on the sales invoice. For more information, see <a href="Document.TaxInvoiceIssued/Help">Tax invoices issued</a>.</p>

<h2>Specifying goods and services to sell</h2>
<p>To specify the goods and services your company sells to a customer according to a sales invoice, use the <strong>Products</strong> tab of the sales invoice page.</p>
<p>The table on the tab lists all goods and services the customer is to pay for, their prices, quantities, the VAT amount, and the total amount. In the table, you can add, edit, and delete items.</p>
<p>If the sales invoice is based on a sales order or another document, the table includes the goods and services the base document includes.</p>
<p>Adding an item and filling its fields is the straightforward way to populate the products table. Also, you can copy existing items, paste them to the table, and update their fields.</p>
<p>The other ways to populate the products table are as follows: </p>

</li><li><a href="#selecting_products_from_stock_and_reserve">Selecting products from stock and reserves</a> 
</li><li><a href="#selecting_ordered_products">Selecting ordered products</a> </li></ul><p></p><a name="selecting_products_from_stock_and_reserve"></a>
<h3>Selecting products from stock and reserves</h3>
<p>When selling a product you might want to check the product's availability before adding it to the sales invoice (whether it is possible to sell it immediately) and put the product in reserve after adding it to the sales invoice (whether it is possible to sell it if the sales invoice is canceled).</p>
<p>For this purpose, use the product selection tool. To open it:</p>
<ul><li>On the <strong>Products</strong> tab of the sales invoice, click <strong>Select &gt; Goods</strong>. </li></ul><p>For more information, see <a href="DataProcessor.ProductsSelection/Help">Selecting products for sales documents</a>.</p><a name="selecting_ordered_products"></a>
<h3>Selecting ordered products</h3>
<p>When populating information on products in a sale invoice, you might want to include some of the products the customer already ordered or even received but you have not invoiced them yet.</p>
<p>For this purpose, use the <strong>Select ordered goods</strong> window. To open it for a sales invoice:</p>
<ol><li>On the Products tab of the sales invoice, click <strong>Select &gt; Ordered goods</strong>. 
</li><li>In the <strong>Select ordered goods</strong> window, select the check boxes for the goods you want to add and enter the quantities. </li></ol><p>The <strong>Select ordered goods</strong> window displays goods included in sales orders and goods issues for the customer. For each of the goods, it indicates its ordered or shipped quantity, price and VAT amount, and the sales order (goods issue). Also, it displays the remaining quantity to invoice.</p>
<p>To switch between goods of the base sales order only and goods of all sales orders and goods issues, select or clear the <strong>Display products from dependent documents only</strong> check box.</p><a name="advance_clearance"></a>
<h2>Performing advance clearance</h2>
<p>If your customer made an advance payment by the moment you issue a sales invoice, you can reduce the customer's debt for the sales invoice.</p>
<p>The table on the <strong>Advance clearing</strong> tab of a sales invoice lists the advance payment documents and the amounts you decided to set off. In the table, you can add, edit, and delete items.</p>
<p>To perform the advance clearance for a sales invoice:</p>
