<h1>Sales orders</h1>
<p>In 1C:Drive, with a <em>sales order</em> document you can track an individual sale your company makes to a customer.</p>
<p>Typically, your sales flow starts with a sales order. Sometimes, you initiate it with a quotation and then generate a sales order based on the quotation.</p>
<p>In the sales order, you specify the customer, the goods and services the customer ordered and their price, and the agreed shipment date.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can specify the payment terms and delivery terms you agreed on.</p>
<p>As sales order are parts of your sales flow, you can use a sales order to generate other documents in the flow: goods issues, sales invoices, and others.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Customer</strong> (required). The customer name. 
</li><li><strong>Contract</strong> (required). The contract governing the sale. This field is only available if the customer's billing details include contracts.

<p>In 1C:Drive, a sales order can reflect both the fact that your company received the expected money for the order from the customer and the fact that your company delivered the goods and services according to the order.</p>
<p>To monitor that both sides of the deal (your company and the customer) fulfilled their obligations, you can use the sales order list.</p>
<p>In the list, for each order, 1C:Drive separately displays its payment status and dispatch status.</p>
<p>Each status is displayed with a colored circle.</p>
<p>The circle color indicates timeliness:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Green</strong>. On time. The deadline is met. 
</li><li><strong>Orange</strong>. In jeopardy. The deadline is reached. 
</li><li><strong>Red</strong>. Overdue. The deadline is missed. </li></ul><p>The circle shape indicates completeness:</p>
<ul><li><img src="_files/fulfilled_in_full.jpg"></img>. Fulfilled in full.
