<h1>RFQ responses</h1>
<p>When you want to learn the prices, terms, and conditions for purchasing goods and services, you can send a request for quotation (RFQ) to a potential supplier. You can register their response as an RFQ response document in 1C:Drive for further analysis.</p>
<p>An RFQ response is a quotation issued by a potential supplier.</p>
<p>You can use an RFQ response as the initial document in your purchasing chain. For instance, you can create a purchase order based on an RFQ response.
