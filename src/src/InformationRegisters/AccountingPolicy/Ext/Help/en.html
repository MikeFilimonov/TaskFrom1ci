<h1>Accounting policy</h1>
<p>For each company for which you keep records in 1C:Drive, create at least one accounting policy.</p>
<p>For the given company, an accounting policy defines the VAT accounting specifics, cash or Earning method of accounting, and other settings.</p>
<p>If you work with several companies in 1C:Drive, accounting policies allow you to define different policies for different companies.</p>
<p>Also, by specifying several accounting policies for the same company you can set that the company uses different policies during different time periods. For instance, the company is not VAT-registered at the moment, but starting from next year, it becomes VAT-registered (say, due to legislation changes or because the company's revenue exceeds the VAT registration threshold). As a result, documents that belong to these periods must post different entries on VAT: without VAT this year and including VAT next year.</p>
<p>If you define several accounting policies for a company, only one of the policies has effect at the given moment. For instance, if a company has two policies, first taking effect on 01 January, 2017 and second taking effect on 01 July, 2018, then from 01 January, 2017 til 30 June, 2018 the company uses the first policy, and from 01 July, 2018 it uses the second policy.</p>
<p>Each accounting policy has the following fields:</p>
<ul><li><b>Finance</b> 
<ul><li><strong>Period</strong>. The date when the policy takes effect. 
</li><li><strong>Company</strong>. The company that owns the policy. 
<p>The <strong>Period</strong> and <strong>Company</strong> fields uniquely identify the policy. Thus, for the same company you cannot create more than one policy taking effect on the same date. For this company, you can create several policies taking effect on different dates.</p><a name="registered_for_vat"></a>
</li><li><strong>Registered for VAT</strong>. Adds VAT-related fields to your accounting documents. Select it if your company is VAT-registered.
