<h1>Editing bank statement mappings</h1>
<p>To edit the mappings that affect the data import from bank statement files to 1C:Drive, click <strong>Cash management &gt; Bank statement mapping</strong>.</p>
<p>Each record in the bank statement mapping table contains a bank, a target attribute, a target attribute value, and a value read from a bank statement file. So, the record maps the data stored in 1C:Drive and the data read from the bank statement file. In other words, it prescribes the rules where 1C:Drive should write the data it reads from the file.</p>
<p>In general, you can create, edit, and delete mapping records. Typically, you create mapping records by using the <strong>Bank Statement Processing</strong> wizard, while here you can simply delete incorrect mapping records and then return to the wizard to create correct ones. For more information, see <a href="DataProcessor.BankStatementProcessing/Help">Importing bank statements</a>.</p></body></html>
